README.md:
This repository contains code and scripts for a cloud-based IoT system developed as part of an assignment. The system collects data from virtual sensors, communicates via MQTT protocol, and visualizes data using ThingSpeak. MATLAB scripts are used for data analysis.

Files:
1. `main.py`: Python script for simulating virtual sensors and publishing data to ThingSpeak.
2. `diagram.json`: Configuration file for setting up the virtual environment in the Wokwi simulator.
3. `HW3_Report1_LatestData.m`: MATLAB script for fetching the latest sensor data from ThingSpeak.
4. `HW3_Report1_5Hours_data.m`: MATLAB script for analyzing sensor data over the last five hours.
